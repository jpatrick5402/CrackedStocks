This is a simple, yet powerful program used to parse data and return the result of stock
market trends, after some algorithms, my program decides whether or not to buy or sell a
given stock. 
If the stock info is unavailable from google, it prints '---None'.

Potential updates include:
  -Automatically investing with an API
  -Parsing websites for top company picks
  -Working with Machine Learning to make investment descisions
