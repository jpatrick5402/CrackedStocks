I have chosen to write both a Python and a C version to highlight the excessive use of simplicities in Python. C, on the
other hand does not give an easy route to write code. The newest generations of programmers are forgetting that Code itself
is not written in a single language but is simply expressed in terms of a language. Python uses as few words as possible.
